# Hi, I'm Nwachukwu Jesse Chijioke

### **Machine Learning & MLOps Engineer**
*Building scalable intelligent systems and robust data infrastructure.*

---

### **What I Build**

I operate at the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **DevOps**, ensuring that models don't just stay in notebooks but drive value in production.

#### **Core Specialization (MLOps)**
- **End-to-End Pipelines** – Architecting workflows from data ingestion to model deployment.
- **Infrastructure Automation** – Containerization (Docker), Orchestration, and CI/CD workflows.
- **Model Observability** – Monitoring drift, performance, and reliability in real-time.

#### **Data Engineering & Automation Services** (Open for Freelance)
- **Data Cleaning & ETL** – Transforming messy raw data (CSV/Excel/JSON) into analysis-ready formats using **Pandas**.
- **Workflow Automation** – Writing robust Python scripts to automate reporting, scraping, and daily tasks.
- **Database Management** – Designing schemas and managing data flow into **PostgreSQL**.


## **Tech Stack**

| **Domain** | **Tools & Technologies** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Languages** | Python, SQL, Bash |
| **Data Engineering** | Pandas, NumPy, PostgreSQL, Apache Airflow |
| **Infrastructure** | Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Linux |
